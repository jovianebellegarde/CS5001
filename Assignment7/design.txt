CS 5001 Fall 2019
HW 7 Design

For my design, I was trying to use functions called in the main to read the
room, item, and puzzles and monsters file and make dictionaries with their
objects as values and either the name, or number of the item from the list
as the key.

I call the menu function in the while loop, to keep prompting the user
to make a choice of north, south, east, or west. With this menu, they can also
choose inventory, look, use, take, drop, look, or quit. The courtyard print
statement then prints where the user originally starts, which would be in the
courtyard.

My intention of the while True loop was to have the choice that the user
choose from the menu and then eventually past through a function called
direction to move from room to room and another function called do_things that
will enable the program to add/remove/print a list of the items the user
interacted with. This function may have added things into a list by using the
classes in the other file for items.

I did not have the opportunity to finish this game, but I understand the main
logic. I just ran out of time to code it because I was really hung up over using
classes and objects to try to get my code to work. At least this HW allows me
to realize where my weaknesses are and to better study for the final.
